//Better approach (siehe http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/curves/cbezarclen.html):
//
//By subdividing the curve at parameter value t you only have to find the length of a full Bezier curve.
//If you denote the length of the control polygon by L1 i.e.:
//L1 = |P0 P1| +|P1 P2| +|P2 P3|
//and the length of the cord by L0 i.e.:
//L0 = |P0 P3|
//then
//L = 1/2*L0 + 1/2*L1
//is a good approximation to the length of the curve, and the difference
//ERR = L1-L0
//is a measure of the error. If the error is to large, then you just subdivide curve at parameter value 1/2, and find the length of each half.
//If m is the number of subdivisions then the error goes to zero as 2^-4m.
//If you dont have a cubic curve but a curve of degree n then you put
//L = (2*L0 + (n-1)*L1)/(n+1)
